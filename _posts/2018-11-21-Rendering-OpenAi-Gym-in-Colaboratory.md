title: Rendering OpenAi Gym in Google Colaboratory.

Early this year (2018) Google introduced free GPUs to their machine learning tool "Colaboratory", making it the perfect platform for doing machine learning work or research.

Also, if you are looking at getting started with Reinforcement Learning, you may have also heard of a tool released by OpenAi in 2016, called "OpenAi Gym". Gym gives you access to a library of training environments with standardized inputs & outputs, allowing your machine learning "agents" to control everything from Cartpoles to Space Invaders.

Unfortunately if you are looking at learning reinforcement learning or even performing research, it is currently impossible to see your agents results "live" in your Colaboratory browser, until now.
